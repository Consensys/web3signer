  summary: 'Reload signer keys asynchronously'
  description: |
    Reloads signer keys asynchronously in the background. This is used after adding new keys to a current set of validators.
    The call accepts the reload request and returns immediately while the actual reload happens asynchronously.
    
    Not used by validator clients - this is an administrative endpoint.
