# Changelog

## 21.10.0

### Features Added
- Upgrade to signers 1.0.19 allows empty password files to be read when creating a Signer [#432](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/pull/432)
- Upgrade Teku libraries version to 21.9.2 to provide support for Altair fork in mainnet [#435](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/pull/435)

### Breaking Changes
- Upgrade to signers 1.0.19 removes support for deprecated SECP256K1 curve in Azure remote signing [#432](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/pull/432)

## 21.8.1

### Features Added
- Added sign type BLOCK_V2 to support block signing for Phase0, Altair and future forks (Eth2 mode). BLOCK is not removed for 
backward compatibility with PHASE0 blocks.
- Upgraded Teku libraries to 21.8.2 which added support for Altair upgrade on Prater testnet at epoch 36660.

### Bugs fixed
- Unable to sign blocks on testnet Pyrmont after Altair fork. (Thanks to [Sephiroth](https://github.com/3eph1r0th) for reporting it.)

## 21.8.0

### Features Added
- Upgraded Teku libraries to 21.8.1. Added support for Altair upgrade on the Pyrmont testnet at epoch 61650.

### Bug fixed
- Spelling mistake fixed in Eth2 OpenApi spec

## 21.7.0

### Breaking changes
- `--network` flag for `eth2` subcommand is now mandatory and defaults to `mainnet`. Use appropriate network when running web3signer for a testnet.
- Database migration scripts (V8__*.sql and V9__*.sql) are required to be executed for this release if slashing protection is used.

### Features Added
- Introduced `--slashing-protection-db-pool-configuration-file` to specify Hikari connection pool configuration file.
- Upgraded gradle and various plugin versions. Switched to new dependency license reporting plugin. Project can now be compiled against JDK 16.
- Introduced --network cli option for Eth2 mode. Defaults to mainnet. Should match the option used by Teku at runtime.
- Upgraded Teku libraries.
- Eth2 slashing protection now has an additional safeguard that prevents multiple signed blocks or attestations being inserted using database constraints.
- Use adoptopenjdk/openjdk11:x86_64-ubuntu-jre-11.0.11_9 as docker base image.

### Bugs fixed
- Fixed transaction deadlock at start up during same validators registration (>10000) from multiple web3signer instances.

## 21.3.0

### Features Added
- Metrics on Vertx event loop and worker thread pools

### Bugs Fixed
- Eth2 slashing protection pruning on startup now runs on a separate thread, so it doesn't block application startup and http requests
- Eth2 slashing protection pruning was deleting the incorrect amount of data in some cases

## 21.2.0

### Features Added
- Reload API endpoint to load new keys
- Slashing protection database pruning for Eth2
- Publish binaries to Cloudsmith
- Resolve Signers from Cloudsmith

### Bugs Fixed
- Fixed build failure when checked out as a shallow clone. Shallow clones are still not recommended as the version number cannot be determined correctly.
- Change reference tests git submodule to https so a github account isn't required to build web3signer

## 21.1.0

### Features Added
- Azure secrets managed identity mode
- Check that database matches expected version on startup
- Added basic Eth2 grafana dashboard (https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13687)

### Bugs Fixed
- Improve query performance of attestations and blocks by adding indexes

- Incorrect options in the openapi spec for Eth2 signing API
- Fix the external link for documentation on OpenAPI documentation

- Eth2 signing API returned body matches incoming request content-type in either plain-text or json
- Only able to sign for a single Genesis validators root (which is defined by the first received request after creation)
- Do not sign below watermark (regardless of if matching existing entry)

### Bugs Fixed
- Eth2 slashing protection metrics category was not working on CLI
- Update Filecoin RPC to be compatible with Lotus remote wallet API
- Eth2 slashing protection returns a 412 http status code for a slashing violation
- Signing with empty slashing database would sometimes fail due multiple genesis validator root values inserting concurrently
