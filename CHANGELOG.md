## 23.6.0

As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver the best remote signing solutions, we are announcing a change in our product offerings.

We have decided to deprecate our [EthSigner](https://github.com/Consensys/EthSigner) product to focus our efforts on enhancing Web3Signer, our newly comprehensive remote signing solution. This is rooted in our strategy to streamline our offerings and focus on a single, robust product that will provide functionality for both transaction and Ethereum validator signing. We hope this makes it applicable to all your use-cases like public Ethereum signing, staking infrastructure offerings, and in private network contexts.

Rest assured, we are not dropping existing EthSigner functionality. We are updating Web3Signer to incorporate the functionalities of EthSigner alongside everything else in Web3Signer. We will ensure a smooth transition by maintaining EthSigner with necessary patches for an additional six months. We hope this provides ample time for any necessary migration to Web3Signer.

**We have begun adding EthSigner functionality to Web3Signer. This is a work in progress and not complete.**

- Support Prometheus Push Gateway Metrics [#796](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/pull/796)
- Cache Genesis Validators Root (GVR) in-memory on first database lookup. This would eliminate further database lookups 
for GVR during sign operations and improve their performance. [#600](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/issues/600)
- Add RPC proxy support to execution client under the eth1 subcommand [#775](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/pull/775)
- Add eth_accounts RPC method under the eth1 subcommand [#784](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/pull/784)

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed handling of very large number (30,000+) of signing metadata files with Hashicorp connection by introducing 
experimental flag to disable parallel processing `--Xmetadata-files-parallel-processing-enabled`. 
[#794](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/pull/794)
- Fixed startup error with web3signer where openAPI spec cannot be loaded [#772](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/issues/772)

- Improved performance for slashing protection import
- Introduced experimental cli option `--Xslashing-protection-db-connection-pool-enabled` to disable internal database 
connection pool (Hikari) to allow using external database connection pool such as pgBouncer. 
`--slashing-protection-db-pool-configuration-file` and `--slashing-protection-pruning-db-pool-configuration-file` can be
reused to specify PG Datasource properties. [#662](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/issues/662)
