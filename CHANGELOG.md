## 22.4.1

### Features Added
- Update various library dependencies

---
## 22.4.0

### Breaking Changes
- Because the web3signer docker image uses the latest LTS tag (ubuntu:latest), the container host may require an update to the latest container runtime. See [Ubuntu bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libseccomp/+bug/1916485) for more details.

### Features Added
- Migrate from the deprecated `vertx-web-api-contract` module to `vertx-web-openapi` [#506](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/pull/506)
- Migrate jackson `ObjectMapper` instances to `JsonMapper` and `YamlMapper` builders to resolve deprecation warnings [#507](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer/pull/507)

---
## 21.10.5
### Bugs Fixed
- Updated to log4j 2.17.1. Resolves two potential vulnerabilities which are only exploitable when using custom log4j configurations that are either writable by untrusted users or log data from the `ThreadContext`.

---
## 21.10.4
### Bugs Fixed
- Updated log4j to 2.17.0 to mitigate potential DOS vulnerability when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup.

---
## 21.10.3

### Bugs fixed
- Updated log4j to 2.16.0 to mitigate JNDI attack via thread context. 
---

## 21.10.2

### Bugs fixed
- Fix multi-arch JDK17 variant docker image to bundle Java 17 instead of Java 11

## 21.10.1

### Features Added
- Docker images are now published with multi-arch support including Linux/amd64 and Linux/arm64
- The default docker image now uses JDK 17 instead of 11. The JDK 11 image is still available with the version suffix `-jdk11`

### Breaking Changes
- The docker image now uses `web3signer` as user/group instead of `root` which may result in compatibility/permissions issues with existing directory mounts.  

### Bugs Fixed
- Updated log4j and explicitly disabled format message lookups.

---

## 21.10.0

## 21.8.1

### Features Added
- Added sign type BLOCK_V2 to support block signing for Phase0, Altair and future forks (Eth2 mode). BLOCK is not removed for 
backward compatibility with PHASE0 blocks.
- Upgraded Teku libraries to 21.8.2 which added support for Altair upgrade on Prater testnet at epoch 36660.

### Features Added
- Introduced `--slashing-protection-db-pool-configuration-file` to specify Hikari connection pool configuration file.
- Upgraded gradle and various plugin versions. Switched to new dependency license reporting plugin. Project can now be compiled against JDK 16.
- Introduced --network cli option for Eth2 mode. Defaults to mainnet. Should match the option used by Teku at runtime.
- Upgraded Teku libraries.
- Eth2 slashing protection now has an additional safeguard that prevents multiple signed blocks or attestations being inserted using database constraints.
- Use adoptopenjdk/openjdk11:x86_64-ubuntu-jre-11.0.11_9 as docker base image.

### Features Added
- Reload API endpoint to load new keys
- Slashing protection database pruning for Eth2
- Publish binaries to Cloudsmith
- Resolve Signers from Cloudsmith

### Bugs Fixed
