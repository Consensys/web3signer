/**
 * A reference-counted holder for a decrypted tenant DEK, allowing it to be safely wiped once
 * evicted from the cache without racing a concurrent decrypt operation.
 *
 * <p>Caffeine's removal listener runs on a maintenance thread with no relationship to whether a
 * decrypt thread is mid-operation holding this exact byte array - directly zeroing the array in the
 * removal listener risks a concurrent thread observing a partially-wiped key. Instead, callers take
 * a short-lived read-lock {@link Lease} to use the key bytes; eviction/rotation/shutdown marks this
 * instance for wipe and attempts a non-blocking write-lock, which only succeeds once every
 * outstanding lease has been closed. Since no new leases can be acquired once a wipe has been
 * requested (see {@link #acquireForRead()}), the outstanding-lease count is monotonically
 * decreasing and the wipe is guaranteed to eventually succeed.
